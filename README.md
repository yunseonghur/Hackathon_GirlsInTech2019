# Hackathon_GirlsInTech2019

Original Idea:
Game => app where users play out scenarios that are harmful to the environment and are given informative facts periodically throughout the game.
	- Lvl 1: a woman in a developing country is struck by disaster! It is her duty as caretaker to ensure her family gets to safety. It's the user's objective to make decisions that will guide the woman to safety and her family to safety.

- What does it do?

- What problem does it try to solve? What was the inspiration behind the project idea?

- What is your stack? What language did you program it in? What APIâ€™s did you use?

- Which part was the most difficult to implement and why?

- What are the next steps to complete the project?
