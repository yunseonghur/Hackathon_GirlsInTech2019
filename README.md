Original Idea:
Game => app where users play out scenarios that are harmful to the environment and are given informative facts periodically throughout the game.
	- Lvl 1: a woman in a developing country is struck by disaster! It is her duty as caretaker to ensure her family gets to safety. It's the user's objective to make decisions that will guide the woman to safety and her family to safety.

	During loading screens / success / failure, the survival-rate of these types of women is presented.
